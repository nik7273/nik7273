- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikhil.
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics. I've mostly worked on robotic planning, but I'm broadly interested in building and understanding end-to-end robotic systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about legged locomotion for humanoids. I don't believe that it will be that necessary in the near future, but it is an enjoyable, difficult problem to work on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project instrumental to scaling robotics, whether it be in the realm of ideas, software or hardware.
- 📫 How to reach me: if you have interesting ideas or questions, email me at devrajn < at > umich.edu
