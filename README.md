- 👋 Hi, I’m Nikhil.
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics. Thus far I've mostly worked on robotic planning and control for humanoids (both manipulation and locomotion) in indoor settings like the home. I'm broadly interested in building and understanding end-to-end robotic systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for employment! While doing so I've been exploring some ideas in perception.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project instrumental to scaling robotics further, whether it be in the realm of ideas, software or hardware.
- 📫 How to reach me: if you have interesting ideas or questions, email me at devrajn < at > umich.edu
